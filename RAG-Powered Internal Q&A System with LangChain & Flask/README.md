# 🌸 **Flower Secret Realm: RAG-Powered Internal Q&A System with LangChain & Flask**

## 📌 **Overview**
The **Flower Secret Realm** is an **AI-powered internal Q&A system** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **LangChain**, and **Flask**. It provides instant, accurate responses to flower-related queries by integrating structured knowledge from internal documents such as the employee handbook, operations guide, and a flower language database.

## 🔹 **Features**
- ✅ **RAG-Based Intelligent Q&A** – Uses **retrieval-augmented generation** to combine document retrieval with an LLM-powered response.
- ✅ **LangChain-Powered Search** – Employs **vector-based retrieval** and **LLM reasoning** to improve answer accuracy.
- ✅ **Flask Web Interface** – A simple and interactive web application for submitting and receiving answers.
- ✅ **Employee Handbook & Operations Guide Integration** – Retrieves HR policies, business strategies, and best practices from internal documents.
- ✅ **Flower Language Guide** – Provides symbolic meanings and interpretations of various flowers.

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. **User Inputs a Question**  
   - Example: *“What does a rose symbolize?”*  
2. **Flask Backend Processes the Query**  
   - Calls the **RAG pipeline** using **LangChain**.  
   - **Vector-based retrieval** fetches relevant data from documents.  
   - The **LLM** combines retrieved information with an AI-generated response.  
3. **Response is Displayed on the Web Interface**  

## 📖 **Example Queries**
	• What are the benefits of lavender in flower arrangements?
	• What is the employee dress code at Fresh Flower?
	• How does the Fresh Flower website generate revenue?
